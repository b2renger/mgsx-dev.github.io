If you get to this page it means you are already in touch with MGSX network, if not you have to [contact us](mailto:info@mgsx.net)

MGSX is nor a company nor an organization nor an entity. It is just a digital creators network.

### Who can join ?

Any body working in the digital creation field including : developers, artists, managers ...

Since MGSX network is a small group of people, we need to discuss first to know each other and state if your presence in the network make sense.
Please [send us an email](mailto:info@mgsx.net) first, we get to you ASAP.

### Why join ?

For now, it's just allow you to have a page and reference you, links to your social networks, website, folio...
It is basically a 2-way partnership : some members could have some project requiring some skills, they could contact you if your skills match the need. So as a memeber you can propose some projects to other members.

### How to join ?

If you know github, it is very easy : you just have to make a pull request that fullfill followinf requirements :

* create a file **_people/[your github account name].md**
* add required and optional metadata (see below)
* add free content in markdown format in the remaining content

Note that information update is made the same way, just PR changes of your own file.

If you want to leave, you can do it the same way : just PR deletion of your file.

### What rules ?

Page is made of a header with metadata and a markdown content following jekyll/gh-pages model.

Metadata are all optional and content is free but have to stay in the MGSX spirit that is it should only contains stuff about digital creation or personal information relevant to the purpose of the network. You can add some links if metadata model doesn't handle it currently.

Example :

```
---
github: mgsx-dev
twitter: mgsx
email: info@mgsx.net
---

Your **markdown** content which could content some <b>html</b> is markdown is *not enough for you*

```
